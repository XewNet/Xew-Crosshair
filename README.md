## ‚ùì FAQ

### Is Xew Crosshair free?
Yes, Xew Crosshair is 100% free for personal use.

### Will Xew Crosshair work with any game?
Most of the time, yes ‚Äî around **90% compatibility**. It works best with games that have a straightforward, static crosshair. Games like *War Thunder* or *World of Tanks*, where the crosshair moves dynamically, may not be fully compatible.

### Can I use this in competitive or online games?
**Use at your own risk.** Xew Crosshair is not a cheat or hack, but some anti-cheat systems may flag overlays. Always check your game's terms of service before using it in online or ranked play.

### Does it work on multiple monitors?
Currently, it displays on your **primary monitor only**. Multi-monitor support is planned in a future update.  
However, you **can launch multiple instances** of Xew Crosshair and drag them to other monitors manually.

### Will it block mouse clicks or inputs?
Nope! The overlay is **click-through**, so it won‚Äôt interfere with gameplay or input at all.

### Why can't I see the crosshair in my game?
Make sure your game is running in **borderless windowed mode**. If you‚Äôre still having issues, try running **Xew Crosshair as administrator**.

### Will there be updates or new features?
Yes! Planned updates include:
- More crosshair designs  
- Hotkey toggles  
- Save/load profile support  
- Color customization
